  abstract = {Multi-modal integration, which combines multiple neurophysiological signals, is gaining more attention for its potential to supplement single modality’s drawbacks and yield reliable results by extracting complementary features. In particular, integration of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is cost-effective and portable, and therefore is a fascinating approach to brain-computer interface (BCI). However, outcomes from the integration of these two modalities have yielded only modest improvement in BCI performance because of the lack of approaches to integrate the two different features. In addition, mismatch of recording locations may hinder further improvement. In this literature review, we surveyed studies of the integration of EEG/fNIRS in BCI thoroughly and discussed its current limitations. We also suggested future directions for efficient and successful multi-modal integration of EEG/fNIRS in BCI systems.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for improved classification of hyperspectral images based on the combination of supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms. In particular, we propose to fuse the capabilities of the support vector machine classifier and the fuzzy C-means clustering algorithm. While the former is used to generate a spectralbased classification map, the latter is adopted to provide an ensemble of clustering maps. To reduce the computation complexity, the most representative spectral channels identified by the Markov Fisher Selector algorithm are used during the clustering process. Then, these maps are successively labeled via a pairwise relabeling procedure with respect to the pixel-based classification map using voting rules. To generate the final classification result, we propose to aggregate the obtained set of spectro-spatial maps through different fusion methods based on voting rules and Markov Random Field theory. Experimental results obtained on two hyperspectral images acquired by the reflective optics system imaging spectrometer and the airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer, respectively; confirm the promising capabilities of the proposed framework.},

The proposed OpenSpyrit ecosystem responds to the need for reproducibility and benchmarking in single-pixel imaging by providing open data and open software. The SPIHIM collection, which is the first open-access FAIR dataset for hyperspectral single-pixel imaging, currently includes 140 raw measurements acquired using SPAS and the corresponding hypercubes reconstructed using SPYRIT. The hypercubes are reconstructed by both inverse Hadamard transformation of the raw data and using the denoised completion network (DC-Net), a data-driven reconstruction algorithm. The hypercubes obtained by inverse Hadamard transformation have a native size of 64 × 64 × 2048 for a spectral resolution of 2.3 nm and a spatial resolution that is comprised between 182.4 µm and 15.2 µm depending on the digital zoom. The hypercubes obtained using the DC-Net are reconstructed at an increased resolution of 128 × 128 × 2048.

The hyperspectral band selection (HBS) task is considered as a clustering problem: bands are clustered in the image space; one representative image is then kept for each cluster, to be part of the set of selected bands. The proposed clustering method falls into the family of information-maximization clustering, where mutual information between data features and cluster assignments is maximized. Inspired by a clustering method of this family, we adapt it to the HBS problem and extend it to the case of multiple image features. A pixel selection step is also integrated to reduce the spatial support of the feature vectors, thus mitigating the curse of dimensionality. Experiments with different standard data sets show that the bands selected with our algorithm lead to higher classification performance, in comparison with other state-of-the-art HBS methods.},

The proposed approach employs several convolutional and pooling layers to extract deep features from HSIs, which are nonlinear, discriminant, and invariant. These features are useful for image classification and target detection. Furthermore, in order to address the common issue of imbalance between high dimensionality and limited availability of training samples for the classification of HSI, a few strategies such as L2 regularization and dropout are investigated to avoid overfitting in class data modeling. More importantly, we propose a 3-D CNN-based FE model with combined regularization to extract effective spectral–spatial features of hyperspectral imagery. Finally, in order to further improve the performance, a virtual sample enhanced method is proposed. The proposed approaches are carried out on three widely used hyperspectral data sets: Indian Pines, University of Pavia, and Kennedy Space Center. The obtained results reveal that the proposed models with sparse constraints provide competitive results to state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract = {Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a technique that can obtain more spectral information than that in normal color images. Due to this property and strength in material classification, it is widely used in remote sensing, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. In recent years, with the rapid developments of hardware, hyperspectral cameras have become more portable and a ordable. An increasing number of studies are being conducted on HSI systems, and research focuses have expanded from remote sensing to close-range objects. With a proper microscopic kit, a hyperspectral camera can capture images of objects of micrometers in size. In this thesis, an HSI system is introduced which consists of a hyperspectral camera, a microscope, control software, and an image processing workstation. The samples are placed under the microscope which has the camera mounted on the top. The parameters of the camera can be tuned by the control software to have the best image quality. After the setup, the camera takes the HSI image of the samples. Then, the image is transferred to the workstation and saved as a raw HSI image for further process. Two datasets of cells and microplastics are collected and introduced as benchmark datasets for this research. The reason to build these two benchmarks is because of their demands. In the area of cell viability assay, traditional methods use uorescent dyes to distinguish live and dead cells. Although working very reliably, they require physical contact with the cells, which a ects the appearance of the cells and some of the original cell features. As a consequence, there is a demand for the development of non-invasive technology for cell analysis. Our HSI system is capable of using computer vision techniques to classify live and dead cells as a non-invasive and systematic method so that the property of the cells can remain unchanged and the system can be operated without special skills. The microplastics dataset is built to address the needs of environmental protection which is an important research topic with significant social and economic values. The increasing amount of microplastics in the ocean has attracted enormous concern because of its potential to damage the ecosystem and a ect the health of humans and animals. While HSI has shown great potential in analyzing microplastics, studies in this direction are hindered by the lack of public available image data. Therefore, there is an urgent so that there is an urgent demand to build a dataset for microplastics detection. After the datasets have been constructed, we evaluate the support vector machine (SVM) on them for the baseline approach. We apply several feature extraction methods to process the HSI images of the cells before feeding them into the SVM, including extended morphology profile (EMP), tensor morphology profile (TMP), 3D scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT3D), 3D local derivative pattern (3DLDP) and spectral-spatial scaleinvariant feature transform (SS-SIFT). Among them, TMP has the best performance for the cell classification task. Regarding the detection of microplastics, the spectral signature is used to extract the feature and is fed into SVM for detection. Furthermore, we propose a novel attention-based convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify the cells to take advantage of the development in deep learning. Inspired by the VGG networks, we first build a classification network for our hyperspectral data. Then, a band weighting network and a spatial weighting network are integrated into the backbone. The band weighting network assigns a weight to each band in the hyperspectral images. The weights can suppress redundant bands that do not make an important contribution to the classification task and make the classification network focus on the bands that have more important features for classification. The spatial weighting network assigns a weight to each pixel in the hyperspectral images. The weights can help the classification network focus on important parts of the images and ignore the irrelevant parts. These two weighting networks help to improve the final classification accuracy of the cells. In the experiments on hand-crafted features, SVM with TMP feature extraction method has the best accuracy of 83.72\% for the cell classification task. SVM with spectral signature produces 99.13\% accuracy on the microplastics detection task. In comparison, the attention-based CNN achieves 98.17\% for the cell classification task. These results show that our HSI system and classification methods have great potential for these two classification and detection tasks. The richness of spectral information that is provided by hyperspectral images has a great potential in material recognition tasks, helping to classify di erent materials based on their unique spectral signatures of each material. Because of this, our research can contribute to a wider range of biomedical and environmental domains.},

  abstract = {The use of hyperspectral imaging for medical applications is becoming more common in recent years. One of the main obstacles that researchers find when developing hyperspectral algorithms for medical applications is the lack of specific, publicly available, and hyperspectral medical data. The work described in this paper was developed within the framework of the European project HELICoiD (HypErspectraL Imaging Cancer Detection), which had as a main goal the application of hyperspectral imaging to the delineation of brain tumors in real-time during neurosurgical operations. In this paper, the methodology followed to generate the first hyperspectral database of in-vivo human brain tissues is presented. Data was acquired employing a customized hyperspectral acquisition system capable of capturing information in the Visual and Near InfraRed (VNIR) range from 400 to 1000 nm. Repeatability was assessed for the cases where two images of the same scene were captured consecutively. The analysis reveals that the system works more efficiently in the spectral range between 450 and 900 nm. A total of 36 hyperspectral images from 22 different patients were obtained. From these data, more than 300 000 spectral signatures were labeled employing a semi-automatic methodology based on the spectral angle mapper algorithm. Four different classes were defined: normal tissue, tumor tissue, blood vessel, and background elements. All the hyperspectral data has been made available in a public repository.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose—Although modern multisequence stroke MRI protocols are an emerging imaging routine for the diagnostic assessment of acute ischemic stroke, their sensitivity for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), the most important differential diagnosis, is still a matter of debate. We hypothesized that stroke MRI is accurate in the detection of ICH. To evaluate our hypotheses, we conducted a prospective multicenter trial. Methods—Stroke MRI protocols of 6 university hospitals were standardized. Images from 62 ICH patients and 62 nonhemorrhagic stroke patients, all imaged within the first 6 hours after symptom onset (mean, 3 hours 18 minutes), were analyzed. For diagnosis of hemorrhage, CT served as the “gold standard.” Three readers experienced in stroke imaging and 3 final-year medical students, unaware of clinical details, separately evaluated sets of diffusion-, T2-, and T2*-weighted images. The extent and phenomenology of the hemorrhage on MRI were assessed separately. Results—Mean patient age was 65.5 years; median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 10. The experienced readers identified ICH with 100\% sensitivity (confidence interval, 97.1 to 100) and 100\% overall accuracy. Mean ICH size was 17.3 mL (range, 1 to 101.5 mL). The students reached a mean sensitivity of 95.16\% (confidence interval, 90.32 to 98.39). Conclusions—Hyperacute ICH causes a characteristic imaging pattern on stroke MRI and is detectable with excellent accuracy. Even raters with limited film-reading experience reached good accuracy. Stroke MRI alone can rule out ICH and demonstrate the underlying pathology in hyperacute stroke. (Stroke. 2004;35:502-507.)},

  abstract = {The development of learning-based hyperspectral image compression methods has recently attracted great attention in remote sensing. Such methods require a high number of hyperspectral images to be used during training to optimize all parameters and reach a high compression performance. However, existing hyperspectral datasets are not sufficient to train and evaluate learning-based compression methods, which hinders the research in this field. To address this problem, in this paper we present HySpecNet-11k that is a large-scale hyperspectral benchmark dataset made up of 11,483 nonoverlapping image patches. Each patch is a portion of 128 × 128 pixels with 224 spectral bands and a ground sample distance of 30 m. We exploit HySpecNet-11k to benchmark the current state of the art in learning-based hyperspectral image compression by focussing our attention on various 1D, 2D and 3D convolutional autoencoder architectures. Nevertheless, HySpecNet-11k can be used for any unsupervised learning task in the framework of hyperspectral image analysis. The dataset, our code and the pre-trained weights are publicly available at https://hyspecnet.rsim.berlin.},

However, the resulting high dimensionality in the feature space may render a classification task unreliable, mainly due to overfitting and the Hughes phenomenon. In order to attenuate such problems, one can resort to dimensionality reduction (DR). Thus, this paper proposes a new DR algorithm, which performs an unsupervised band selection technique following a clustering approach. More specifically, the data set was split into a predefined number of clusters, after which the bands were iteratively selected based on the parameters of a separating hyperplane, which provided the best separation in the feature space, in a one-versus-all scenario. Then, a fine-tuning of the initially selected bands took place based on the separability of clusters. A comparison with five other state-of-the-art frameworks shows that the proposed method achieved the best classification results in 60\% of the experiments.},

EEG-fNIRS signals are simultaneously recorded to achieve high motor imagery task classification. This integration helps to achieve better system performance, but at the cost of an increase in system complexity and computational time. In hybrid BCI studies, channel selection is recognized as the key element that directly affects the system’s performance. In this paper, we propose a novel channel selection approach using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, where only highly correlated channels are selected from each hemisphere. Then, four different statistical features are extracted, and their different combinations are used for the classification through KNN and Tree classifiers. As far as we know, there is no report available that explored the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient for hybrid EEG-fNIRS BCI channel selection. The results demonstrate that our hybrid system significantly reduces computational burden while achieving a classification accuracy with high reliability comparable to the existing literature.},

At present, the researchers mostly use the classic airborne hyperspectral imagery as the benchmark dataset. However, existing datasets suffer from three bottlenecks: (1) low spatial resolution; (2) low labeled pixels proportion; (3) low degree of subclasses distinction. In this paper, a new benchmark dataset named the Wuhan UAV-borne hyperspectral image (WHU-Hi) dataset was built for hyperspectral image classification. The WHU-Hi dataset with a high spectral resolution (nm level) and a very high spatial resolution (cm level), which we refer to here as H2 imager. Besides, the WHU-Hi dataset has a higher pixel labeling ratio and finer subclasses. Some start-of-art hyperspectral image classification methods benchmarked the WHU-Hi dataset, and the experimental results show that WHU-Hi is a challenging dataset. We hope WHU-Hi dataset can become a strong benchmark to accelerate future research.},

Airborne hyperspectral imagers still perform a vital role in remote sensing fields due to advantages of spatial resolution, performance capabilities in a cloudy atmosphere, and onboard maintenance as compared to similar imagers aboard spaceborne platforms. To date, hundreds of airborne hyperspectral systems have been designed, built, and operated. Here, a review of key technologies for airborne hyperspectral imaging technology during past three decades is presented. First discussed will be high throughput imaging modes, high quality spectroscopic subsystems, and high sensitivity detector technology used on current airborne hyperspectral imagers. Particularly, the importance of data-processing such as calibration, geometric rectification, and atmospheric correction are discussed. Next, several new and novel applications are presented on the basis of state-ofthe-art airborne hyperspectral technology. Finally, an outlook of challenges and future technology directions is presented along with general advice for designing and realizing novel high-performance airborne hyperspectral systems in this rapidly evolving field. By illustrating the status and prospects of typical airborne hyperspectral imagers, this overview provides a comparison of the technologies employed in previous hyperspectral imaging systems, current imaging technology research programs and prospects for innovative technology in future airborne hyperspectral imaging platforms.},

  abstract = {Multispectral and hyperspectral images are well established in various fields of application like remote sensing, astronomy, and microscopic spectroscopy. In recent years, the availability of new sensor designs, more powerful processors, and high-capacity storage further opened this imaging modality to a wider array of applications like medical diagnosis, agriculture, and cultural heritage. This necessitates new tools that allow general analysis of the image data and are intuitive to users who are new to hyperspectral imaging. We introduce a novel framework that bundles new interactive visualization techniques with powerful algorithms and is accessible through an efficient and intuitive graphical user interface. We visualize the spectral distribution of an image via parallel coordinates with a strong link to traditional visualization techniques, enabling new paradigms in hyperspectral image analysis that focus on interactive raw data exploration. We combine novel methods for supervised segmentation, global clustering, and nonlinear false-color coding to assist in the visual inspection. Our framework coined Gerbil is open source and highly modular, building on established methods and being easily extensible for application-specific needs. It satisfies the need for a general, consistent software framework that tightly integrates analysis algorithms with an intuitive, modern interface to the raw image data and algorithmic results.

  abstract = {Over the past three decades, significant developments have been made in hyperspectral imaging due to which it has emerged as an effective tool in numerous civil, environmental, and military applications. Modern sensor technologies are capable of covering large surfaces of earth with exceptional spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. Due to these features, hyperspectral imaging has been effectively used in numerous remote sensing applications requiring estimation of physical parameters of many complex surfaces and identification of visually similar materials having fine spectral signatures. In the recent years, ground based hyperspectral imaging has gained immense interest in the research on electronic imaging for food inspection, forensic science, medical surgery and diagnosis, and military applications. This review focuses on the fundamentals of hyperspectral image analysis and its modern applications such as food quality and safety assessment, medical diagnosis and image guided surgery, forensic document examination, defense and homeland security, remote sensing applications such as precision agriculture and water resource management and material identification and mapping of artworks. Moreover, recent research on the use of hyperspectral imaging for examination of forgery detection in questioned documents, aided by deep learning, is also presented. This review can be a useful baseline for future research in hyperspectral image analysis.},

  abstract = {Recently, the field of hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is dominated by deep learning-based methods. However, training deep learning models usually needs a large number of labeled samples to optimize thousands of parameters. In this article, a deep multiview learning method is proposed to deal with the small sample problem of HSI. First, two views of an HSI scene are constructed by applying principal component analysis to different bands. Second, a deep residual network is designed to embed the different views of a sample to a latent space. The designed deep residual network is trained by maximizing agreement between differently augmented views of the same data sample via a contrastive loss in the latent space. Note that the training procedure of the designed deep residual network does not use labeled information. Therefore, the proposed method belongs to the category of unsupervised learning, which could alleviate the lack of labeled training samples. Finally, a conventional machine learning method (e.g., support vector machine) is used to complete the classification task in the learned latent space. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments are carried on four widely used hyperspectral data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method could improve the classification accuracy with small samples.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing is a useful tool for monitoring spatio-temporal variations of crop morphological and physiological status and supporting practices in precision farming. In comparison with multispectral imaging, hyperspectral imaging is a more advanced technique that is capable of acquiring a detailed spectral response of target features. Due to limited accessibility outside of the scientific community, hyperspectral images have not been widely used in precision agriculture. In recent years, different mini-sized and low-cost airborne hyperspectral sensors (e.g., Headwall Micro-Hyperspec, Cubert UHD 185-Firefly) have been developed, and advanced spaceborne hyperspectral sensors have also been or will be launched (e.g., PRISMA, DESIS, EnMAP, HyspIRI). Hyperspectral imaging is becoming more widely available to agricultural applications. Meanwhile, the acquisition, processing, and analysis of hyperspectral imagery still remain a challenging research topic (e.g., large data volume, high data dimensionality, and complex information analysis). It is hence beneficial to conduct a thorough and in-depth review of the hyperspectral imaging technology (e.g., different platforms and sensors), methods available for processing and analyzing hyperspectral information, and recent advances of hyperspectral imaging in agricultural applications. Publications over the past 30 years in hyperspectral imaging technology and applications in agriculture were thus reviewed. The imaging platforms and sensors, together with analytic methods used in the literature, were discussed. Performances of hyperspectral imaging for different applications (e.g., crop biophysical and biochemical properties’ mapping, soil characteristics, and crop classification) were also evaluated. This review is intended to assist agricultural researchers and practitioners to better understand the strengths and limitations of hyperspectral imaging to agricultural applications and promote the adoption of this valuable technology. Recommendations for future hyperspectral imaging research for precision agriculture are also presented.},

  abstract = {In recent years, vector-based machine learning algorithms, such as random forests, support vector machines, and 1-D convolutional neural networks, have shown promising results in hyperspectral image classification. Such methodologies, nevertheless, can lead to information loss in representing hyperspectral pixels, which intrinsically have a sequence-based data structure. A recurrent neural network (RNN), an important branch of the deep learning family, is mainly designed to handle sequential data. Can sequence-based RNN be an effective method of hyperspectral image classification? In this paper, we propose a novel RNN model that can effectively analyze hyperspectral pixels as sequential data and then determine information categories via network reasoning. As far as we know, this is the first time that an RNN framework has been proposed for hyperspectral image classification. Specifically, our RNN makes use of a newly proposed activation function, parametric rectified tanh (PRetanh), for hyperspectral sequential data analysis instead of the popular tanh or rectified linear unit. The proposed activation function makes it possible to use fairly high learning rates without the risk of divergence during the training procedure. Moreover, a modified gated recurrent unit, which uses PRetanh for hidden representation, is adopted to construct the recurrent layer in our network to efficiently process hyperspectral data and reduce the total number of parameters. Experimental results on three airborne hyperspectral images suggest competitive performance in the proposed mode. In addition, the proposed network architecture opens a new window for future research, showcasing the huge potential of deep recurrent networks for hyperspectral data analysis.},

Markov diffusions are defined on the space of HSI spectra with transitions constrained to near spatial neighbors. The explicit incorporation of spatial regularity into the diffusion construction leads to smoother random processes that are more adapted for unsupervised machine learning than those based on spectra alone. The regularized diffusion process is subsequently used to embed the high-dimensional HSI into a lower-dimensional space through diffusion distances. Cluster modes are computed using kernel density estimation and diffusion distances, and all other points are labeled according to these modes. The proposed method has low computational complexity and performs competitively against state-of-the-art HSI clustering algorithms on real data. In particular, the proposed spatial regularization confers both theoretical and empirical advantages over nonregularized methods.},

  abstract = {The problem of unsupervised learning and segmentation of hyperspectral images is a significant challenge in remote sensing. The high dimensionality of hyperspectral data, presence of substantial noise, and overlap of classes all contribute to the difficulty of automatically clustering and segmenting hyperspectral images. In this article, we propose an unsupervised learning technique that combines a geometric estimation of class modes with a diffusion-inspired labeling that incorporates both spatial and spectral information. The mode estimation incorporates the geometry of the hyperspectral data by using diffusion distance to promote learning a unique mode from each class. These class modes are then used to label all points by a joint spatial-spectral nonlinear diffusion process. The proposed method, called spatial-spectral diffusion learning (DLSS), is shown to perform competitively against benchmark and state-ofthe-art hyperspectral clustering methods on a variety of synthetic and real datasets. The proposed methods are shown to enjoy low computational complexity and fast empirical runtime. Two variations of the proposed method are also discussed. The first variation combines the proposed method of mode estimation with partial least squares regression (PLSR) to efficiently segment chemical plumes in hyperspectral images for anomaly detection. The second variation incorporates active learning to allow the user to request labels for a very small number of pixels, which can dramatically improve overall clustering results. Extensive experimental analysis demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods, and their robustness to choices of parameters.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has established the state of the art in multiple fields, including hyperspectral image analysis. However, training large-capacity learners to segment such imagery requires representative training sets. Acquiring such data is humandependent and time-consuming, especially in earth observation scenarios, where the hyperspectral data transfer is very costly and time-constrained. In this letter, we show how to effectively deal with a limited number and size of available hyperspectral groundtruth sets and apply transfer learning for building deep feature extractors. Also, we exploit spectral dimensionality reduction to make our technique applicable over hyperspectral data acquired using different sensors, which may capture different numbers of hyperspectral bands. The experiments, performed over several benchmarks and backed up with statistical tests, indicated that our approach allows us to effectively train well-generalizing deep convolutional neural nets even using significantly reduced data.},

The samples, consisting of hyperspectral cubes collected from 400 nm to 1000 nm, were acquired from ten different patients diagnosed with high-grade glioma. Based on the diagnosis provided by pathologists, a spectral library of normal and tumor tissues was created and processed using three different supervised classification algorithms.

Traditional digitized histopathological slides are imaged with RGB imaging. Utilizing HSI/MSI, spectral information across wavelengths within and beyond the visual range can complement spatial information for the creation of computer-aided diagnostic tools for both stained and unstained histological specimens. In this systematic review, we summarize the methods and uses of HSI/MSI for staining and color correction, immunohistochemistry, autofluorescence, and histopathological diagnostic research. Studies include hematology, breast cancer, head and neck cancer, skin cancer, and diseases of central nervous, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary systems. The use of HSI/MSI suggest an improvement in the detection of diseases and clinical practice compared with traditional RGB analysis, and brings new opportunities in histological analysis of samples, such as digital staining or alleviating the inter-laboratory variability of digitized samples. Nevertheless, the number of studies in this field is currently limited, and more research is needed to confirm the advantages of this technology compared to conventional imagery.},

  abstract = {Over the past decades, many methods have been proposed to solve the linear or nonlinear mixing of spectra inside the hyperspectral data. Due to a relatively low spatial resolution of hyperspectral imaging, each image pixel may contain spectra from multiple materials. In turn, hyperspectral unmixing is finding these materials and their abundances. A few main approaches to performing hyperspectral unmixing have emerged, such as nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), linear mixture modelling (LMM), and, most recently, autoencoder networks. These methods use different approaches in finding the endmember and abundance of information from hyperspectral images. However, due to the huge variation of hyperspectral data being used, it is difficult to determine which methods perform sufficiently on which datasets and if they can generalize on any input data to solve hyperspectral unmixing problems. By trying to mitigate this problem, we propose a hyperspectral unmixing algorithm testing methodology and create a standard benchmark to test already available and newly created algorithms. A few different experiments were created, and a variety of hyperspectral datasets in this benchmark were used to compare openly available algorithms and to determine the best-performing ones.},

  abstract = {Brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) provide bidirectional communication between the brain and output devices that translate user intent into function. Among the different brain imaging techniques used to operate BCIs, electroencephalography (EEG) constitutes the preferred method of choice, owing to its relative low cost, ease of use, high temporal resolution, and noninvasiveness. In recent years, significant progress in wearable technologies and computational intelligence has greatly enhanced the performance and capabilities of EEG-based BCIs (eBCIs) and propelled their migration out of the laboratory and into real-world environments. This rapid translation constitutes a paradigm shift in human–machine interaction that will deeply transform different industries in the near future, including healthcare and wellbeing, entertainment, security, education, and marketing. In this contribution, the state-of-the-art in wearable biosensing is reviewed, focusing on the development of novel electrode interfaces for long term and noninvasive EEG monitoring. Commercially available EEG platforms are surveyed, and a comparative analysis is presented based on the benefits and limitations they provide for eBCI development. Emerging applications in neuroscientific research and future trends related to the widespread implementation of eBCIs for medical and nonmedical uses are discussed. Finally, a commentary on the ethical, social, and legal concerns associated with this increasingly ubiquitous technology is provided, as well as general recommendations to address key issues related to mainstream consumer adoption.},

Different approaches were used to select the best image data processing in order to gather the relevant spectral information. This was attained by selecting the pixels of the region of interest (ROI), using a pre-calculated threshold value of the PCA scores arranged as histograms, to select the spectra set; summing up the selected spectra to achieve representativeness; and compensating for the superimposed filter paper spectral information, also supported by scores histograms for each individual sample. The best classification model was achieved using linear discriminant analysis and genetic algorithm (LDA/GA), whose correct classification rate in the external validation set was 92\%. Previous classification of the type of additive present in the gasoline is necessary to define the PLS model required for its quantitative determination. Considering that two of the additives studied present high spectral similarity, a PLS regression model was constructed to predict their content in gasoline, while two additional models were used for the remaining additives. The results for the external validation of these regression models showed a mean percentage error of prediction varying from 5 to 15\%.},

The multistage algorithm consists of two stages. The “local” segmentor of the first stage performs region-growing segmentation by employing the hierarchical clustering procedure of CN-chain with the restriction that pixels in a cluster must be spatially contiguous. The “global” segmentor of the second stage, which has not spatial constraints for merging, clusters the segments resulting from the previous stage, using a contextfree similarity measure. This study applied the multistage hierarchical clustering method to the data generated by band reduction, band selection and data compression. The classification results were compared with them using full bands.},

  abstract = {Hyperspectral imaging is a non-destructive, nonpolluting, and fast technology, which can capture up to several hundred images of different wavelengths and offer relevant spectral signatures. Hyperspectral imaging technology has achieved breakthroughs in the acquisition of agricultural information and the detection of external or internal quality attributes of the agricultural product. Deep learning techniques have boosted the performance of hyperspectral image analysis. Compared with traditional machine learning, deep learning architectures exploit both spatial and spectral information of hyperspectral image analysis. To scrutinize thoroughly the current efforts, provide insights, and identify potential research directions on deep learning for hyperspectral image analysis in agriculture, this paper presents a systematic and comprehensive review. Firstly, its applications in agriculture are summarized, include ripeness and component prediction, different classification themes, and plant disease detection. Then, the recent achievements are reviewed in hyperspectral image analysis from the aspects of the deep learning models and the feature networks. Finally, the existing challenges of hyperspectral image analysis based on deep learning are summarized and the prospects of future works are put forward.},

In this paper, we exploit deep learning techniques to address the hyperspectral image classification problem. In contrast to conventional computer vision tasks that only examine the spatial context, our proposed method can exploit both spatial context and spectral correlation to enhance hyperspectral image classification. In particular, we advocate four new deep learning models, namely, 2-D convolutional neural network (2-D-CNN), 3-D-CNN, recurrent 2-D CNN (R-2-D-CNN), and recurrent 3-D-CNN (R-3-D-CNN) for hyperspectral image classification. We conducted rigorous experiments based on six publicly available data sets. Through a comparative evaluation with other state-of-the-art methods, our experimental results confirm the superiority of the proposed deep learning models, especially the R-3-D-CNN and the R-2-D-CNN deep learning models.},

The proposed method efficiently combines data density and spectral-spatial geometry to distinguish between material classes in the data, without the need for training labels. The proposed method is efficient, with quasilinear scaling in the number of data points, and enjoys robust theoretical performance guarantees. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real HSI data demonstrate its strong performance compared to benchmark and state-of-the-art methods. Indeed, the proposed method not only achieves excellent labeling accuracy, but also efficiently estimates the number of clusters. Thus, unlike almost all existing hyperspectral clustering methods, the proposed algorithm is essentially parameter-free.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks have proven to be very effective for computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation – these are primarily applied to color imagery and video. In recent years, there has been an emergence of deep learning algorithms being applied to hyperspectral and multispectral imagery for remote sensing and biomedicine tasks. These multichannel images come with their own unique set of challenges that must be addressed for effective image analysis. Challenges include limited ground truth (annotation is expensive and extensive labeling is often not feasible), and high dimensional nature of the data (each pixel is represented by hundreds of spectral bands), despite being presented by a large amount of unlabeled data and the potential to leverage multiple sensors/sources that observe the same scene. In this chapter, we will review recent advances in the community that leverage deep learning for robust hyperspectral image analysis despite these unique challenges – specifically, we will review unsupervised, semi-supervised and active learning approaches to image analysis, as well as transfer learning approaches for multi-source (e.g. multi-sensor, or multi-temporal) image analysis.},
